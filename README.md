## 🚙 Parking Space Detection Project Using Image Processing and Object Recognition

**Team Name:** 기둥 뒤에 공간 있어요!  
**Project Duration:** August 20, 2024 - September 9, 2024  
**Team Members:**  
- **마석빈 (Team Lead):** Model building, visualization development, data preprocessing.  
- **김서희:** Data analysis, YOLO data preprocessing, model training, log management.  
- **박달님:** Data preprocessing, model training, image augmentation.
